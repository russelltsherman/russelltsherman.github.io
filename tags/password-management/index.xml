      <description>The 1Password for Teams product by AgileBits is argubably the most popular SaaS-based password management tool. In our opinion, it offers a better user experience over apps like LastPass as well as provides integration with Duo and Slack for real-time activity notifications.
Best Practices Here are some of our recommended practices for working with 1Password. If your organization choses an alternative password management solution, we recommend implementing compensating controls.
Enable Real-time Slack Notifications With real-time slack notifications, you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to monitor logins for anomalies.</description>
