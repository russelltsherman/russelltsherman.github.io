      <description>Background The make command has been around for decades. Predominantly, it was used to build complex projects in C &amp;amp; C++, but it&amp;rsquo;s seen a resurgence in the ops world for automating routine tasks and orchestration of infrastructure-as-code. In the 12-factor pattern, these are your “admin tasks”.
Understanding Makefiles Because make is a very simple language, there&amp;rsquo;s not very much you need to learn to get started. Some things, however, might seem unintuitive when approaching it from the perspective of other languages.</description>
